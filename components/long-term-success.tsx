                You know what's funny about building a lasting relationship with your pet? It's a lot like tending to a
                garden. You don't see results overnight, but with consistent care and attention, something magical
                happens.
              </p>
              <p>
                We've seen it countless times â€“ pet parents checking health metrics daily, hoping for quick
                improvements, feeling concerned when progress seems slow. But here's what we've learned: true pet
                wellness isn't about dramatic overnight changes. It's about getting 1% better each day, showing up when
                motivation is low, and trusting that these small improvements compound over time.
